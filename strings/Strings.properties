gameDesc = &emsp;Mana Spark is about humanity being the weak minority. You are a hero that fights constantly under disadvantage. The enemies work together to kill you, there are traps along the way and you have only your bow and your dodging skills. While other races, like the elves, live in a prosperous society fueled by Mana, humans have being subjugated, massacred and enslaved. The absence of Mana in the human race left it exposed to the power of magic without any way to counterattack, leading to abuses like the recent mysterious kidnapping outbreak. How long this recklessness will last?<br> Some say the fight has already begun.<br><br>
